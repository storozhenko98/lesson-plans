# PHI315 September 11 Lesson Plan: Unraveling the Notion of “Intelligence”

## Introduction: The Evolution of "Intelligence"

In today's session, we'll embark on an in-depth exploration of one of the most debated concepts in philosophy and psychology: “intelligence.” This term, often casually thrown around in daily conversations and academic discussions, carries a weight of multiple meanings, implications, and connotations. Our journey today aims to illuminate the multifaceted nature of intelligence, tracing its evolution and how our understanding of it has shifted over centuries. By dissecting its semantics, we will uncover crucial debates around the intersection of natural human cognition and its artificial counterparts.

## I. Etymological Origins

Before diving into more contemporary discussions, it's valuable to understand where the term “intelligence” originated. 

- **Roots in Latin:** The word stems from the Latin roots – “intus,” which translates to “inwardly,” and “legere,” meaning “to choose or pick out.” Thus, in its nascent form, intelligence referred to an inward act of discernment, highlighting the introspective nature of understanding or making sense of information.

## II. Evolution of the Term Over Time

### A. Middle Ages: A Bridge between Thought and Action

- **1300s Shift:** By the 1300s, the definition of intelligence began to morph. It came to encompass not just introspection but the “ability to acquire and apply knowledge.” This was a significant pivot, as it connected the internal realm of thoughts with the external realm of actions, emphasizing the application of knowledge.

### B. Modern Era: The Rise of Quantification

- **1800s Scientific Curiosity:** With the dawn of the modern era and the burgeoning scientific interest, there was a push to quantify and measure everything, including intelligence. The era saw the introduction of metrics such as IQ tests that aimed to gauge cognitive capabilities in a standardized manner.
  
- **Criticisms and Bias:** However, these methods of quantification were not without their detractors. Many scholars and thinkers argued that these tests bore inherent cultural biases, suggesting that they couldn't capture the diverse expressions of intelligence across cultures and societies. This debate paved the way for theories like Howard Gardner's “multiple intelligences,” which posited that intelligence is not monolithic but multi-dimensional.

## III. Constituents of Intelligence

As we delve deeper into the concept, it's imperative to ask: What really makes up intelligence? While definitions vary, some of the universally recognized facets include:

1. **Abstract Reasoning:** The ability to understand and solve problems not bound by concrete reality.
2. **Spatial/Mechanical Abilities:** Understanding relationships in physical space.
3. **Linguistic Skills:** Mastery over language and communication.
4. **Interpersonal Awareness:** The capacity to understand and interact with others.
5. **Intrapersonal Self-Knowledge:** Deep self-awareness and self-understanding.
6. **Musical Intelligence:** Aptitude in recognizing and creating musical tones and rhythms.
7. **Bodily Kinesthetics:** The ability to use one's body in highly differentiated ways.

However, this leads us to pivotal questions: Are all these facets essential to deem someone intelligent? Is there a unified theory of intelligence, or is it a conglomeration of various cognitive talents? Furthermore, where do emotions fit in this puzzle? Are they intertwined with intelligence, or do they operate on a separate plane?

## IV. Machine Intelligence: A Comparison

As we transition into the age of machines, it's crucial to draw parallels and distinctions between human and artificial intelligence.

- **AI Proficiency:** While AI systems have showcased unparalleled prowess in tasks like complex calculations, games like chess, and data analysis, does this constitute intelligence in the human sense?
  
- **Limitations and Potentials:** Can computational intelligence ever truly emulate or surpass human cognitive capabilities? Or are there aspects of our "carbon-based" brains that are inherently unique and irreplaceable?
  
- **Substrate Neutrality:** A fundamental question arises – is intelligence substrate-neutral? Can it manifest irrespective of whether it's in a biological or a silicon-based entity? Or will the trajectories of biological and artificial minds inevitably diverge?

## Conclusion: Synthesis and Forward Look

As we wrap up today's session, we'll synthesize our discussions and ponder the future trajectories of understanding intelligence. This exploration is not just academic but has profound implications for education, policy-making, and the integration of AI into our societies.

Join us in this captivating journey as we decode and deconstruct “intelligence,” a term that has, and will continue to, shape the human experience.
