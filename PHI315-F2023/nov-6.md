# PHI315 November 6 Agenda 

## Schedule this week 

Today we will discuss the stuff we have watched so far, with philosophical background in context. 

Wednesday you will have your paper workshop -- directions will be discussed, updates given. Specifically, I will give you general feedback on your paper and explain what I expect out of the second one, and you will have time to work on it. 

Then, Friday, we will begin a new unit, where we see how sci fi helps us explore our existential condition as human beings with a finite life and an uncertain direction and an ungrounded existence. 

## PI, AR/VR Discussion 

We watched: San Junipero, Star Trek, Matrix, Tron, and Total Recall. 

What have we learned from these in regard to AR/VR and Personal Identity? 

What we think before? 

What do we think now? 

Have we attained that uncertainty that we seek?
