# PHI315 : Oct 4 -- Wrapping up AI Section 

Alright everyone, today we wrap up our AI section. I will go over your paper on Friday, and you will work on it in class, in a workshop style session. More details on that forthcoming, but, as a means of relieving possible anxiety, it will not be a difficult assignment if you did what was expected of you in class--namely, watching films, and writing your reflections. 

For today, I want to talk about the following. Since the point of this class is to use science fiction as a means of broadening what you think possible and then using philosophy to apply that to the present, I should like to ask, roughly, what can we infer from all that we have seen in the movies and all that we have talked about? 

Here are some suggested axes along which we can proceed with this discussion: 

1. With movies such as *Her*, *Ex Machina*, *Blade Runner(s)* and so on, a question emerges: are these artificially intelligent and artificially alive organisms truly intelligent and alive? 

2. With the undermining of the notion of artificiality, and the progress in the AI technology that we see today, is there something to be said about the coming future? 

3. Some of the movies we watched seemed to hint toward the notion that we ought to extend our moral framework toward these artificially intelligent and alive entities, should we? 

4. How do you feel about the technology that presently exists? Suppose that in a couple years, you will have a digital assistant, one that generates an image for itself, a voice, a name. It will seem to have a kind of person-hood. How will that make you feel?

5. Have any of the movies that we have watched made you more / less nervous for the future? What can we learn from what we have seen as we continue to progress technologically into the foray with the AI systems?
