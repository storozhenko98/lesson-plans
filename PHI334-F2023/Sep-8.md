# PHI 334 : Industry to Neo-Liberalism | September 

Today I mainly want to discourse on the following topics: 

1. Fordism 
2. Post-Fordism
3. Business of Business 

Most of it will be in talking, since I think that is more organic. I will fill out this lesson plan after class, and see if this way of doing things is better. I think that a lot of the time, when I have been teaching you lot, I have been mostly speaking. That is fine--I am the instructor, and as a consequence, I am here to instruct, to tell you about things. At the same time, I want it to also be a way for you to participate. So I am just going to specify some things briefly, and cover the rest verbally, hopefully with you engaging. 

## Fordism 

This is a mode of industrial business, mainly identified with industry and industrial mode of economy. Named after Henry Ford. Has to do with not only assembly line, but standardization and the origin of demand. Coincides with social interpretations of a business. 

## Post-Fordism 

This is a mode of production that comes after Ford, evident in cars, but actually in all manner of commerce. Has to do with standardization, emergence of advertising, Edward Bernays -- nephew of Freud, and also rotation of interpretation regarding obligations of a business. 

## Business of Business 

In the 50-70s, we undergo a transformation, with neoliberalism emerging on the scene in late 70s and early 80s, it was of course gradual. The Friedman essay is excellent on this--the business of business is business and nothing else, nothing more. Consumer demand drives everything, and here too, the consumer becomes a producer, capital unto one self. We will discuss this Monday.
