# PHI 334 Discussion : Organs, Drugs, and Bodies as Markets Nov 6

So, we have, thus far, looked at three markets: that of organs, drugs, and bodies. Today I want to discuss a few things, and reach consensus. 

First: Do you buy into the notion that even if you do not actively participate in these markets, their existence nonetheless affects your ability to live a good life? 

Second: Do you buy into the notion that there are systems that we can change, and systems that are far beyond us that we are unable to do? Do you agree with the implications? (I.E. Change what you can, do not think about that which is beyond you)

Third: Of all the markets we have discussed, which do you find most troubling? Why this one and not the other ones? 

Fourth: What aspects of the markets that we covered do we have control over? 

Fifth: Would you still participate in some of these markets if your life was on the line?
