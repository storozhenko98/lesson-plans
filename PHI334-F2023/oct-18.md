# PHI334 LP: Corporate Culture | Oct 18

Today, we will discuss the notion of corporate culture, what it is, and the implications it has on living a good life. This is an important topic to discuss. First, corporate culture is inescapable. Even corporations that avoid having any kind of in-culture form a culture nonetheless. Second, the in-culture of a corporation affects your being in that corporation--it will affect how you work, how you live after work, and so on. Third, if you one day plan to own your own business, you need to be aware of the importance of culture. 

## What is corporate culture? 

Corporate culture is the atmosphere, vibe, expectation, way of doing things, that you find in a corporation. Often it is couched in values, principles, ways of doing things, written and unwritten rules. It is usually set by leadership, and then trickles down throughout the company. Often, the way of doing things ***just is*** the culture of the company. Office arrangement, what one wears, the things one does, how meetings go, the relations between various departments and levels in a company--all of that is culture. The parties hosted, the expectations of behavior, that too is culture. Culture is the ubiquitous vibe and atmosphere and way of doing things at a particular corporation, hence corporate culture. 

## Today 

Corporate culture today is not confined to corporations. As I have mentioned, we live in neoliberal times, and all places are corporations in a sense. UKY has a corporate culture, and each department has its own particular variation of it. Even if you have a part time job at some singular restaurant, that place now has their own culture as well. There are expectations, values, principles that one is expected to conform to. 

## Absence of Culture 

Some corporations or environments might not have an identifiable culture that they drill into your head as soon as you join. But these places have a culture as well. Anywhere there are people who are stuck together, there emerges a culture, a way of doing things. Sometimes corporations will not mention a culture but enforce one implicitly, which is again, a type of culture. So anywhere you go, there will be a kind of corporate culture that you have to fit into. 

## Examples of Corporate Culture 

1. **Google**: Google's corporate culture is known for its focus on innovation, open communication, and work-life balance. Their offices are often filled with amenities such as nap pods, free food, and recreational areas, emphasizing the value they place on employee well-being. Their slogan "Don’t be evil" (though now somewhat modified) speaks to their aspiration of acting with integrity and avoiding harm to others.

2. **Apple**: Apple's culture is intensely focused on design, simplicity, and innovation. Steve Jobs' legacy of perfectionism and dedication to creating high-end, user-friendly products persists today. The company encourages its employees to push boundaries and think differently.

3. **Netflix**: Netflix has a unique corporate culture encapsulated in their document, "Netflix Culture: Freedom & Responsibility". They emphasize values such as candor, agility, and freedom, but also expect high performance from their employees.

4. **Goldman Sachs**: A global investment bank known for its professional, competitive, and result-driven culture. Employees are encouraged to uphold the firm's commitment to clients and maintain a strong work ethic.

6. **Southwest Airlines**: Their culture is heavily rooted in a sense of fun, camaraderie, and customer-first attitude. Employees are often seen sharing jokes with passengers, and the company prides itself on its low fares and high-quality customer service.

10. **Patagonia**: This outdoor clothing brand is deeply committed to environmental activism. Their corporate culture emphasizes sustainability, ethical sourcing, and encouraging employees to take action on environmental causes.

## Why These Can Be Harmful

While corporate cultures can often serve to guide and unify a company's workforce, there are potential drawbacks and harms that can arise from certain practices or intense adherence to these cultures:

1. **Conformity Over Individuality**: When a corporate culture is too rigid or too strictly enforced, it can stifle creativity, innovation, and the unique contributions of individual employees. This can lead to a lack of diversity in thought and approach, hampering a company's ability to adapt and innovate.

2. **Overwork and Burnout**: Companies that prioritize high performance and constant growth can inadvertently create a culture of overwork. Employees might feel the need to put in excessively long hours, leading to burnout, health issues, and decreased job satisfaction.

3. **Toxic Positivity**: Some corporate cultures emphasize always being positive, which can prevent employees from voicing legitimate concerns or issues. This can mask underlying problems within the company and lead to unresolved tensions.

4. **Suppression of Dissent**: In cultures that prioritize uniformity or have a hierarchical structure, employees may feel that they cannot speak up or disagree with company decisions, even if they have valid criticisms.

5. **Ethical Concerns**: Some corporations might prioritize profit over ethical considerations, pushing employees to act in ways that conflict with their personal values or societal norms. This can lead to unethical business practices and harm to the company's reputation.

6. **Exclusionary Practices**: Companies that have a very defined or narrow corporate culture may inadvertently exclude potential employees from diverse backgrounds. This lack of diversity can harm the company's growth and decision-making processes.

7. **Mental Health Concerns**: High-stress cultures or those that don't prioritize the well-being of employees can contribute to mental health issues. Lack of support, resources, or understanding about mental health can exacerbate these problems.

8. **Lack of Work-Life Balance**: Companies that blur the lines between work and personal life might intrude on employees' personal time, leading to dissatisfaction and turnover.

9. **Fear of Failure**: Cultures that don't tolerate mistakes can prevent employees from taking risks or trying new approaches. This fear of failure can hamper innovation and growth.

10. **Erosion of Trust**: In environments where the corporate culture emphasizes competition over collaboration, there might be a breakdown of trust among colleagues. This can reduce teamwork and hamper the overall efficiency of the company.

## Benefits: Welcoming, Non-Toxic, and So On

While there are potential drawbacks to corporate culture, there are also significant benefits to having a positive and inclusive corporate culture. When done right, a healthy corporate culture can be good, really. 

1. **Increased Employee Engagement**: Employees in companies with a strong positive culture feel more connected to their work and the company's mission. This increased engagement can lead to higher levels of productivity and enthusiasm for their roles.

2. **Attracting Talent**: A welcoming and inclusive corporate culture can attract top talent. Prospective employees often consider company culture as a deciding factor when choosing between job offers.

3. **Lower Turnover Rates**: Employees are more likely to stay with a company where they feel valued, heard, and supported. This reduces costs associated with hiring and training new employees.

4. **Improved Collaboration**: In companies with a culture of open communication and teamwork, employees are more likely to collaborate effectively, share ideas, and work cohesively.

5. **Enhanced Innovation**: Positive corporate cultures that encourage creativity and outside-the-box thinking can lead to groundbreaking ideas and innovations.

6. **Boosted Morale**: A positive, non-toxic work environment can significantly boost employee morale, leading to greater job satisfaction and overall happiness.

7. **Strengthened Company Reputation**: A company known for its excellent corporate culture is likely to have a strong reputation in the industry, attracting business partners, investors, and customers.

8. **Support in Times of Crisis**: In companies with a robust corporate culture, employees are more likely to support each other and the company during challenging times, ensuring resilience and adaptability.

9. **Employee Development**: Corporations with a focus on continuous learning and growth often offer training programs, mentorship, and opportunities for advancement, leading to personal and professional development for employees.

10. **Ethical Behavior**: Companies with strong values and principles embedded in their culture are more likely to make ethical decisions, benefiting society at large.
