# Lesson Plan August 28, PHI334

Today, we begin that part of our class where we completely and thoroughly examine what <<business>> actually is. This class is called business ethics, and I do not see how we can do an ethic of something unless we break down programmatically, as it were, what that something is. 

Philosophy is a multiplicity--there are different fields within philosophy that ask different questions. Ontology is that field that examines the nature of being. For example, what makes me who I am is an ontological question since it is a question about the very essence of my being. Another word for this is metaphysics. 

Now, some think that ontological questions are ahistorical--they pertain to that which is eternal, never changes, and so on. The idea behind this way of thinking is that we do not need to do history to understand essences. However, I disagree with this approach since I think that things change over time. 

## Detour into Metaphysics and Ontology 

I want to linger on this question a little bit. We are speaking about essences, and we are trying to get at the essence of business. Here is a problem: I have asserted that I think that things change over time. But, if something changes over time, it becomes a different thing altogether, since what made it what it is differs. 

In other words, if the essence changes, then it is a different thing that comes and goes. Suppose you have a piece of clay. At some point, it is just clay. But if you make it into a statue, it becomes other. While it matters that the statue is made of clay, if we are studying what makes the statue what it is, we probably do not care about the inessential, such as whether it is clay. 

There is a distinction therefore to be made between essential and nonessential properties. Essential properties are what is inherent to the thing in question, and arguably what makes it precisely what it is. In other words, a thing would not be what it is if it did not exhibit some essential properties or attributes. Nonessential properties are accidental facts about a thing that do not define it, though can be said about the thing. 

Here is an example. Consider fishing, and how sometimes you catch the same species. What makes a red snapper what it is? Certainly it is not size, since they vary in size but we still call them red snapper. It is not sex, since it does not matter whether a red snapper is male or female. But, it is something, and it is the general way it looks, the genetic code nowadays, perhaps some features about it. There is something about a red snapper that makes it what it is, and there are some things about a red snapper that can variate and still make the snapper remain itself. 

So, when it comes to history and change over time, it is important to understand that I do not mean to say that the essence of a thing becomes different. The essence remains the same, but the presentation and manifestation changes. Social practices, and we will discuss that business is one, have an essence too, but they change in how they are enacted and performed, not only over time but also culturally. 

Friendship is a social phenomena with a certain essence. But it takes many forms, and historically has differed. For example, even something like 100 years ago, it was taboo for unmarried men and women to be just friends. Some today still think it is impossible for men and women to be just friends, but generally, socially the attitude has changes. This means we learn about essence too as the presentation changes. 

Here is another thought. When things change over time but we call it by the same name, we see that what has changes about it is not essential to it, for we would have used a different name. Thus, with friendship, we see that 100 years ago, someone might have said that the essence of friendship is that it is a tight bond between two men or two women. Today, we would not say so, for we generally think that the sex of a friend is irrelevant to whether they are a friend. 

The same logic, I assert, applies to business and hence it is important to look at it historically, since doing so allows us to abstract away the inessential and the historically contingent, therefore revealing what it is in and of itself. Moreover, the importance 

So, let us recap real quick. This is a business ethics class. Thus, we need to understand what the essence of business is. But, business is a dynamically
