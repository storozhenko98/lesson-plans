# PHI334 Exam 1 | September 15

This is your first exam and it will query you on your comprehension of the materials we have covered so far. What we have covered so far: 

1. Business Ontology as Such 
2. Business in Antiquity 
3. Business in transition to Industry 
4. Industrial Business 
5. Business in transition to Neo-Liberalism 
6. Neo-Liberal Business 

For your exam, I want you to answer the following questions. The length of the response I expect is specified at the end of the question. Your responses must reference the lesson plans I have provided. 

Questions: 

1. What is the fundamental approach to exploring the notion of business that I proposed on August 28? Why did we look at business historically? What was the point of looking at different phases of business in relation to essence? You must explain how the essence of business and historical expression are connected. **300 Words Minimum**

2. Compare and contrast business in the Antiquity with business in Neo-Liberal society today. I want you to explain mobility, the role of the last name one has, and the way in which one views one's preoccupation. That is, how does what one does change between Antiquity and Today? I do not want intermediate steps, I want an explanation of the old way and the new way. **300 Words Minimum**

3. Explain the difference between Fordist and Post-Fordist mode of production. What drives demand under Fordism? What drives demand under Post-Fordism? In explaining the way in which demand works, be sure to explain what each is, essentially, and how one's business was at the time. **300 Words Minimum**

4. Explain the purpose of having explored the essence of business. This is not the same as question one. I would like to know why we are studying business in the first place, and how it has anything at all to do with ethics. I want you to tell me the main aim of this class, the plan I outlined early on. **300 Words Minimum**

5. I would like for you to reflect on business today and explain whether you find the historical trajectory I described compelling, or if you disagree. If you disagree, I welcome it, but I would like to see your thought process. The same holds for agreeing. I want a reflection, a sincere one, on what has been covered so far. **300 Words Minimum**
