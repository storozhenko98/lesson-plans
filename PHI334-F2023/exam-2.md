# PHI334 Test 2: Ethics Section

Alright, your second exam is about ethics and morality--the stuff we have covered over the last two weeks. Answer the questions below to the best of your ability, you should aim for at least 300 words per response. Like last time, feel free to work in groups at your table and ask me questions if you have any. Be sure to cite the lesson plans in your responses. 

## Questions 
Here are your exam questions. 

### Question 1: Utilitarianism 
Explain what utilitarianism, as a moral theory, is. In your response, address what the main principle is. How the principle is interpreted differently--so, as a reminder, views on utility and for whom it is counted. Then, explain the kind of dilemmas that seem most appropriate for utilitarianism, and explain what intuition it appeals to. Finally give one critique either from Nietzsche or Schopenhauer. 

### Question 2: Deontology 
Explain what Kantian deontology is, as a moral theory. Explain duty, the moral law, and the categorical imperative. Briefly say what the three formulations are. I want a main overview of the theory. What matters when evaluating a moral action? Then, explain what intuition it appeals to. Finally give one critique either from Nietzsche or Schopenhauer. 

### Question 3: Virtue Ethics 
Explain virtue ethics. Be sure to mention eudaimonia in your explanation. Pick a virtue from the 12, and explain it along with its vice counterparts, both in terms of deficiency and excess. Explain why virtue ethics is immune from the critiques levied by Nietzsche and Schopenhauer toward other moral theories. 

### Question 4: Your Views
Explain which view appeals to you the most, why, and whether morality is something you think about a lot. There is no wrong answer here, I am curious is this is something that entered your mind prior to the class, and what it means for you.
